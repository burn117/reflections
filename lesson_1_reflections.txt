How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?

Most of the time, we have a old version who worked
and when we try some new things we make bug
When we compare the old version and the new one
we can see the difference and find the error if it's
a typo.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can use the old files to compare with the new one
as we see in the last question.
But also, you can restore an old version who is working
if you have an actual who needs some modification.
And you have some save in case of big problem like loose
your computer.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros : You know when you do it so you remeber the changes
You sure that the code compile when you do it
Cons : You can forget to do it sometimes and loose things


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It's because Git is optimized for code files
and most of the time the code files are linked
with other files.
In the other hand, Google Docs is for document like
Powerpoint or word who are not really linked each other


How can you use the commands git log and git diff
to view the history of files?

Git log show me the history of files and then I can compare
them with git diff


How might using version control make you more confident
to make changes that could break something?

It's really easy to go back and see what is breaking
so don't worry


Now that you have your workspace set up,
what do you want to try using Git for?

In fact I want to use it for an android project
for a home made appliction. But it is a little big
for the fisrt try. So may be it's more reasonable
to try it on my actual matlab work
