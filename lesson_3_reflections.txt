When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

It can be interesting to share my work or
work with different computer in different
place. It is also a good cloud storage


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if we are more than one to work on a project, when someone
push something, it will modify my version I'm working on and I don't
want that to happen


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

fork : to clone an online git and do my stuff on it
clones : to work directly on the git and commit or push on it
branch : really local process to work on experimental things


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?

To know if there some new file in the remote when we will
try to push or pull some data trought it
